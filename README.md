# ENTER  DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED 
The task involved creating a visually appealing and interactive portfolio website using modern web development tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with GSAP animations. The primary goal was to design a professional-looking website that highlights an individual’s skills, expertise, and personal brand, while providing a seamless user experience. Below is a detailed explanation of the steps undertaken to achieve this.

1. Structuring the Website with HTML
The website's structure was carefully designed using HTML to ensure clarity and semantic organization. The webpage includes three main sections:

Hero Section: The hero section greets visitors with a prominent introduction, a short description, and a call-to-action (CTA) button. This section immediately grabs attention and sets the tone for the rest of the site.
About Section: This section provides an overview of the individual, showcasing their passion and expertise in web development and design.
Skills Section: A visually dynamic skills section highlights key technical competencies, using skill cards to make the content more engaging.
Each section was crafted with proper HTML5 semantic tags, such as <header>, <section>, and <div>, to ensure accessibility and maintainability.

2. Styling with CSS
To enhance the website's visual appeal, extensive use of CSS was made. The design includes:

A full-screen hero section with a stunning background image that sets a professional and captivating first impression.
A dark theme with vibrant accent colors (like orange) to create a modern and bold aesthetic.
Responsive design to ensure the website looks great on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
Hover effects were added to elements such as buttons and skill cards to create a more interactive experience. Smooth transitions and animations were also implemented to maintain a polished and user-friendly design.

3. Adding Animations with GSAP
To make the website more dynamic and engaging, GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) was integrated. The following animations were implemented:

The hero section elements (title, description, and button) smoothly animate into view when the page loads, using sliding and scaling effects with easing functions.
Scroll-triggered animations were added for the “About Me” section, which fades and slides into view as the user scrolls down the page.
The animations were configured with delays and easing effects (power3.out) to make them fluid and visually appealing.
4. Enhancing User Experience
A Call-to-Action (CTA) button in the hero section encourages visitors to interact with the site. Smooth scrolling functionality was added to ensure seamless navigation between sections. The "Skills Section" was designed with hoverable skill cards, enhancing interactivity.

5. Technologies and Tools Used
The project was built using:

HTML for structuring content.
CSS for styling and responsive design.
JavaScript with GSAP for animations.
Live Server (VS Code) for testing and running the website locally.
Deliverable
The final deliverable is a modern portfolio website with:

A captivating hero section.
Informative about and skills sections.
Smooth animations and transitions for an engaging user experience.
This project serves as an excellent representation of professional web design and development skills.
